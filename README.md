#  Loan Approval Prediction System – Mini ML Project

This is a simple Machine Learning project to predict **Loan Approval** status based on applicant details using classification models.

##  Dataset

- `LoanPrediction(Train).csv` – Used for training the ML model.
- `LoanPrediction(Test).csv` – Used for evaluation/testing.

##  Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree (optional)

##  Key Steps:

1. Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling  
2. Label & One-Hot Encoding  
3. Feature Scaling (Standardization)  
4. Model Building & Evaluation  
5. Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

##  Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- VS Code

##  Output

The final model predicts whether a person is **eligible for loan approval** or not (`Y/N`).

###  Results

- Accuracy (Random Forest): `85%` approx (example)
- Evaluation Metrics: Confusion matrix + Precision + Recall
